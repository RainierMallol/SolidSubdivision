Solid Subdivision
=============================

This repository holds a compilation of crowdsource software development best practices. Each .md file holds a snippet of knowledge that describes a behavior marked as a best practices by the programming community. 

All content is mantained by independent developers that wish to contribute. Everyone is welcome to add, improve, and discuss all entries. 

We've automated a twitter account ([@SolidSubdiv](https://twitter.com/SolidSubdiv)) to post a random short entry every 12 hours. This way devs that do not contribute to the repository can still benefit from the compounded knowledge of the community. 

We post entries using a simple node.js script that can be found here: https://github.com/amhed/SolidSubdivision-Service

Some things to consider when adding new content:

* Every entry needs to contain a short description. The first line of the .md file is the content we will send out in each tweet. 
* Every entry must have at least a paragraph explaining the best practice. The content needs to be a MarkDown file. This simplifies hosting, and the MD syntax allows for code examples with ease
* For now, entries should be language agnostic. If you need to write code, do it in the language you feel most comfortable with, but try to add an example that can be applicable to other technologies as well. 
* If the entry has references to known authors or sources, please include them as a link (in the case of a book, please add reference(s) to where it can be bought)
* Don't aim to write a full-fledged compendium on one entry. It the topic is lenghty or complicated, try to synthetize and explain it in simple words. If the reader wants to learn more, that's what the references are for.
* We still don't know how to handle multiple language references on each entry (suggestions welcome)

**Current Goals:**

* Contribute at least 30 entries to the project before turning on the twitter bot
* Find collaborators willing to moderate pull requests
* Spread the word with fellow devs
* Find a better name :neutral_face:

Made with love by people who love sharing knowledge :laughing:
